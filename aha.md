# The PowerPoint Problem: Common Issues

## Limited data integration
PowerPoint does not support live data connections. Charts and tables use static data from Excel, so users must update them manually when data changes. This can lead to old or incorrect data being shown in reports.

> *Example:* A sales team presents quarterly revenue charts, but the data updates every week. Since PowerPoint does not update charts automatically, outdated numbers may be shown, causing wrong decisions.

## Manual updates nightmare
Every time data changes, users must copy-paste new numbers into PowerPoint. This takes time and increases the chance of mistakes.

### Workflow comparison
| Feature            | PowerPoint | Python (e.g., Matplotlib, Plotly) |
|--------------------|-----------|----------------------------------|
| Auto-updating charts | ❌ No       | ✅ Yes (live data connection)   |
| Data accuracy    | ❌ Error-prone | ✅ Reliable                   |
| Efficiency        | ❌ Slow       | ✅ Automated                  |

## Poor version control
PowerPoint files are shared via email or cloud storage, which can lead to multiple versions. This makes teamwork harder because it is difficult to track changes.

> **Analogy:** PowerPoint is like a whiteboard—when you change something, it is hard to see past versions. Python tools work with Git, allowing version control and easy tracking of changes.

## Inconsistent styling
Different people may use different fonts, colors, and chart styles, making presentations look inconsistent. Unlike coding tools, PowerPoint requires manual formatting, which can lead to errors.

### Examples of inconsistent styling
- Different color schemes for the same type of chart
- Varying font sizes across slides
- Misaligned charts due to manual placement

## Hard to maintain accuracy
PowerPoint does not check for errors, so mistakes in charts and labels often go unnoticed. A wrong label, a misaligned chart, or outdated data can cause misunderstandings.

> *Case study:* A finance report had a bar chart with incorrect labels, leading to wrong conclusions by stakeholders.
